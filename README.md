# A-Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediction-Model
A Flight Price Prediction designed to analyze and predict the cost of airline tickets. This Model consists of several components consists of data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and predictioThe technologies used are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Random Forest Regressor, Randomized Search CV.
The model is trained using historical data to identify patterns and relationships between these factors and the price of tickets. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on future ticket prices.
The model typically consists of several components, including data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction. The data collection process involves gathering relevant data from various sources, such as airlines, travel agencies, and online travel portals. The data is then preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies and ensure its accuracy.
This Data is of Airline Operations from 01-03-2019 to 09-06-2019.
